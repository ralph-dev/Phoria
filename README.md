PHORIA INC.’s mission is to promote and raise awareness of gender equality amongst young adults. Our aim is to establish our company as a pioneer in this youth-obsessed industry and build a brand name that will be synonymous with the fashion industry revolution. PHORIA INC.’s vision is to become the world’s leading gender-neutral apparel brand. Furthermore, gender equality is currently becoming a topic of importance amongst Canadians. It is also worth mentioning that our prime minister, Justin Trudeau, is placing much focus on the topic as not enough is being done to resolve it hence why we have the social issue we have today. It is our goal to help be a part of solving this.
